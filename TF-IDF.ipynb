The way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn't scientifically prove any of this, but that didn't matter to her. Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to.\n","Here's the thing. She doesn't have anything to prove, but she is going to anyway. That's just her character. She knows she doesn't have to, but she still will just to show you that she can. Doubt her more and she'll prove she can again. We all already know this and you will too.\n","She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, \"What's your favorite animal?\" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.\n","There was something in the sky. What exactly was up there wasn't immediately clear. But there was definitely something in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger.\n","It really didn't matter what they did to him. He's already made up his mind. Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it.\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"dLD_qIOIsEaf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647551915387,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Hazique Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GicKTM2IdQRKg8kexfW5oeupPruSNPylxUuCami=s64","userId":"18262102521938165140"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Cleaning data\n","import re\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer "],"metadata":{"id":"QZ53PXugvx7z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647552194411,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":621,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Hazique Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GicKTM2IdQRKg8kexfW5oeupPruSNPylxUuCami=s64","userId":"18262102521938165140"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(paragraph)\n","corpus = []"],"metadata":{"id":"c3OmNioOwlzd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647552307252,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":594,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Hazique Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GicKTM2IdQRKg8kexfW5oeupPruSNPylxUuCami=s64","userId":"18262102521938165140"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in range(len(sentences)):\n","  words = re.sub(\"[^A-Za-z]\",\" \",sentences[i])\n","  words = words.lower()\n","  words = words.split()\n","  words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words if word not in set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))]\n","  words = \" \".join(words)\n","  corpus.append(words)"],"metadata":{"id":"rSe2FzWdxKrF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647552699019,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":2454,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Hazique Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GicKTM2IdQRKg8kexfW5oeupPruSNPylxUuCami=s64","userId":"18262102521938165140"}}},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()\n","X = tfidf.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()"],"metadata":{"id":"HT3HAMaMyi3Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647552897139,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Hazique Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GicKTM2IdQRKg8kexfW5oeupPruSNPylxUuCami=s64","userId":"18262102521938165140"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(X)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tM-5v4v0zhvL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647552915040,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":628,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Hazique Khatri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GicKTM2IdQRKg8kexfW5oeupPruSNPylxUuCami=s64","userId":"18262102521938165140"}},"outputId":"7918715f-0dde-4121-e550-a7dc2deee33d"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]\n"," [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.35366123 0.         0.        ]\n"," [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]\n"," ...\n"," [0.         0.55242907 0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]\n"," [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]\n"," [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"yZEsqpaXzmCC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
